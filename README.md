Deep Learning Project: Text Translation from English to Indonesia using Transformer + Indonesian Text Summarizer using BART

We also uploaded our model summarizer model to huggingface
https://huggingface.co/Mr-FineTuner/Summary-model-better

In the demo file, you can use our model to try various input. Run it on Google Colab so you can connect your python notebook into the Google Drive easily.

Before you execute file "Demo_Deeplearning.ipynb", make directory "DeepLearning_UAS" in directory Drive/MyDrive at Google Drive first. After that, make directory "data" and "results" in directory "DeepLearning_UAS". Download "translation_data.zip" file here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nDmHfkMcuuH9kN-Yp6IHBwanCSleBTo2/view?usp=sharing

Move the "eng-indo.txt" to directory "data" that has been created before.

Unzip the "translation_data.zip". After unzip, move it to directory "results" that has created before. This is a Transformer model for translate.

Now, you can run it freely.

If you want to know how the summarizer and translate model trained, you can run "Summarizer_Bart.ipynb" and "Translate_Transformer.ipynb".
